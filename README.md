# Age-Related-Conditions-Identification
This repository contains code for identifying age-related conditions using machine learning techniques. The code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries and tools for data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and evaluation.

# Dependencies
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
'pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn'
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of three CSV files:

train.csv: Training data that includes features and target variable.
test.csv: Test data for making predictions.
greeks.csv: Metadata information about the dataset.
Please ensure that you have these files in the appropriate directory before running the code.

# Data Preprocessing
The code performs the following data preprocessing steps:

Load the training and test data from the CSV files.
Merge the training and test data for preprocessing.
Encode the categorical variable EJ using label encoding.
Merge the metadata information with the data based on the Id column.
Split the merged data back into training and test sets.
Split the training data into features (X) and target variable (y).
Split the training data into train and validation sets using stratified sampling.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The code includes several visualizations to explore the dataset:

Distribution of the target variable (Class): This plot shows the count of each class in the target variable.
Correlation matrix of the features: This heatmap illustrates the correlation between different features.
Distribution of each numerical feature: This set of histograms displays the distribution of each numerical feature, with the option to differentiate by the target variable.
Distribution of the categorical feature EJ: This plot shows the count of each category in the EJ feature, differentiated by the target variable.
# Feature Importance
The code utilizes a Random Forest classifier to determine the importance of features. It follows these steps:

Define preprocessing steps, including imputation and scaling of numerical features.
Create a column transformer to apply the preprocessing steps to numerical features.
Define the Random Forest classifier.
Create a pipeline that combines the preprocessing steps and the classifier.
Fit the pipeline on the training data.
Calculate feature importances from the trained Random Forest classifier.
Plot the feature importances in descending order.
# Model Training and Evaluation
The code trains and evaluates the model using the following steps:

Define the pipeline with the best parameters.
Perform cross-validation using a 5-fold strategy and compute the logarithmic loss.
Make predictions on the validation set and evaluate the model using logarithmic loss.
Make predictions on the test set.
Prepare a submission file with the predictions.
# Results
The code outputs the following results:

Cross-Validation Logarithmic Loss: This is the average logarithmic loss across the cross-validation folds, which indicates the performance of the model.
Pipeline Configuration: This section provides the configuration details of the pipeline, including the preprocessing steps and classifier parameters.
Validation Logarithmic Loss: This is the logarithmic loss on the validation set, which assesses the performance of the model on unseen data.
Prediction: This displays the predicted probabilities for each class on the test set.
Submission File: The code generates a submission CSV file with the predictions for submission.
Please note that the actual paths of the input files and submission file may vary depending on your system configuration. Make sure to update the file paths accordingly.
